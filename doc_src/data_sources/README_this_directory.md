# About the `.../data_sources/` directory


* This directory is intended to keep local data sources in various forms but the most practiced will be probably `JSON`

* Directory is subject to being updated by "external" systems (such a procedure in a database server which produce here `JSON` files)

* Also this directory behavior, as seen by `Web HTTP Server`, is `READ ONLY`
