**The parameters mean:**

* `BASE_URL` see [Note 1](#notes)

* `entity name` is the name of desired data entity. This should be known and represent something like a data "cluster", a data domain, in SQL is most appropriate of "schema". There is no default value.

* `object name` is the name of the data object, equivalent of "table" in SQL. This should be known and there is no default value.
