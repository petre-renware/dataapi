This document presents **RENware Software Systems** company ***data API*** application provider. It refer the public company data.

<small markdown>For a better understanding read the [note section at the end of document](#notes).</small>
 
**General information:**

* *product name:* RENware Data API
* *product version:* 1.0
* *product p/n:* `0000-0051`




## Routes general rules

There are 2 kind of routes:

* **static** data *GET / READ* routes, prefixed as
```
<BASE_URL>/data_sources/[entity name][/object name]
```

* **dynamic** API routes that are able for complete *CRUD* operations to data, prefixed as
```
<BASE_URL>/api/<entity name>/[operation]/<object name>[?query parameters]
```

**The parameters mean:**

* `BASE_URL` see [Note 1](#notes)

* `entity name` is the name of desired data entity. This should be known and represent something like a data "cluster", a data domain, in SQL is most appropriate of "schema". There is no default value.

* `object name` is the name of the data object, equivalent of "table" in SQL. This should be known and there is no default value.

* `operation` is the desired data operation (ie, `CRUD` like). Operation "codes" are specific and specified for each API route. Default operation is considered the `GET / READ` one.

* `query parameters` standard sequence of parameters for data querying or modifying (ie, attributes level data). Query parameters start with `?` charater followed by attributes and their values. The format for query poo parameters definition is conform to HTML standards.


**Other "good to know" rules**

* Dynamic API routes can have *query parameters* specified, meaning that they "knows to use" and respond accordingly.
* Static routes will ignore any query parameters.




## Data formats and meta information

API type is **`HTTP REST`** for data purposes**. That means the basic and if no otherwise specified data type is **`JSON`** returned as standard *HTTP header* and with application type **`application/json`** and **`UTF-8`** encoding.

The JSON objects contains more data structures, but **effective data is located under key `data`**<sup>see Note 2</sup> which is in  mostly cases a `list / array` of other objects (effective data rows).

### Meta information

JSON objects contains an embedded object / dictionary dedicated to *information regarding respective object*. This oject is at *first level in JSON* and has the following structure (keys are important, values are just examples):

```
...
"meta_info": {
    "last_update": "Date as <string> using an ISO format, for example YYYY-MM-DD, ex; 2021-09-30",
    "version": "Version as <SemVer string>, ex; 6.1.8, the patch number being optional",
    "name": "Object code-name as <string>",
    "description": "Object description as <string>"
}
...

```

* (1) ***`BASE_URL`*** represents the `server name` part of the URL, ie at current version being `http://dataapi.renware.eu/` (please be aware to not duplicate last `/` character)

* (2) ***effective data*** the effective data in data objects is also called *payload* term which is an alternate one but
complete equivalent
