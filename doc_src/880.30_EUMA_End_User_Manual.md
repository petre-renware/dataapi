**General information:**

* product p/n: `0000-0051`
* API type: `HTTP REST` for data purposes



## Routes general rules

There are 2 kind of routes:

* **static** data *GET / READ* routes, prefixed as
```
<BASE_URL>/data_sources/[entity name][/object name]
```

* **dynamic** API routes that are able for complete *CRUD* operations to data, prefixed as
```
<BASE_URL>/api/<entity name>/[operation]/<object name>[?query parameters]
```

**The parameters mean:**

* `BASE_URL` see [Note 1](#notes)

* `entity name` is the name of desired data entity. This should be known and represent something like a data "cluster", a data domain, in SQL is most appropriate of "schema". There is no default value.

* `object name` is the name of the data object, equivalent of "table" in SQL. This should be known and there is no default value.

* `operation` is the desired data operation (ie, `CRUD` like). Operation "codes" are specific and specified for each API route. Default operation is considered the `GET / READ` one.

* `query parameters` standard sequence of parameters for data querying or modifying (ie, attributes level data). Query parameters start with `?` charater followed by attributes and their values. The format for query poo parameters definition is conform to HTML standards.


**Other "good to know" rules**

* Dynamic API routes can have *query parameters* specified, meaning that they "knows to use" and respond accordingly.
* Static routes will ignore any query parameters.
